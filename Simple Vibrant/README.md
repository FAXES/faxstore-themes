# Simple Vibrant
For a long time I know I have always wanted to clean up the look of FaxStore V2 to better suit both my personality, and my business design. So, I created this theme to keep things simple, as they were, but also, bring a little more vibrance to my version of FaxStore. With a redesign of pretty much every button, and a few page touch ups, this theme is sure to bring out a little more vibrance, and color sleekness in your FaxStore environment.

There are more changes in this theme, but these are the ones I decided I wanted to show off!
